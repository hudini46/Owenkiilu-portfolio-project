A company/educational institution needs a program to manage their employee/student records. Write a C program that provides the following functionalities:

Add a new employee/student record:

Prompt the user to enter the necessary details such as name, age, address, and contact information.
Generate a unique ID for each new record.
Store the record in an appropriate data structure.
Search for an employee/student record:

Prompt the user to enter the ID or name of the employee/student they want to search for.
Display the details of the matching record if found.
If multiple records match the search criteria, display all matching records.
Update an employee/student record:

Prompt the user to enter the ID or name of the employee/student they want to update.
Allow the user to modify the details of the selected record (e.g., name, age, address, contact information).
Delete an employee/student record:

Prompt the user to enter the ID or name of the employee/student they want to delete.
Confirm the deletion and remove the corresponding record from the data structure.
Display all employee/student records:

Display all the records stored in the data structure, along with their details.
Your program should have the following features:

Use appropriate data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists) to store and manage the records.
Implement efficient search and retrieval algorithms to handle a large number of records.
Handle scenarios where no matching record is found during search/update/delete operations.
Provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the program and display results clearly.
